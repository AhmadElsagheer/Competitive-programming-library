# Linear DS
---
## Outline
1. Static Array
	 1. Creating 1D, 2D, ND Static Arrays.
	 2. Accessing Time.
	 3. Traversing a static array with N dimensions.
	 4. 1D Array Manipulation
	 5. 2D Array Manipulation
	 	* Example: Rotating a matrix.
	 6. Pitfalls when creating a static array
	 	* Example: int[] a, b; a = b = new int[10]; will lead to a and b point to same array.
         7. Different sizes for different rows in a 2D static array.
	        * Example: int[][] a = new int[2][]; a[0] = new int[10]; a[1] = new int[12];
	 8. Algorithm used by Arrays.sort() on array of primitive types and on array of objects.
2. Dynamically-Resizable Array
	 1. Creating ArrayLists , Vectors
	 2. How this is achieved internally , Resizing complexity
	 3. ArrayLists vs Vectores , which is better
	 4. Important functions and their complexity
	 	* Example : add, get, remove
	 5. Using Static Arrays with Dynamically-Resizable Arrays
	        * ArrayList<Integer> a[];
	 6. Algorithm used by Collections.sort()
3. BitSet
	1. Important functions and their complexity
		* Example: reset, set, cardinality , flip, nextSetBit , and, xor
	2. Boolean Arrays vs Bitsets
	
4. Bitmasks
	1. Bit Manipulation
		* Example: Flipping i-th bit in an integer.
5. LinkedLists
	1. Important functions and their complexity
	2. Why it is usually avoided
		* Example: A linear scan is needed to find an element.
	3. Time complexity of sorting LinkedLists.
6. Stacks
	1. Important functions and their complexity
		* Example pop, push, peek, empty, search
	2. Applications on Stacks
7. Queues
	1. Important functions and their complexity
	2. Applications on Queues 
8. Dequeues
   	1. Important functions and their complexity
