/**
 * A DynamicProgramming based solution for Edit Distance problem In Java
 * Description of Edit Distance with an Example:
 * <p>
 * Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings (e.g., words) are to one another,
 * by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other. The
 * distance operations are the removal, insertion, or substitution of a character in the string.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The Distance between "kitten" and "sitting" is 3. A minimal edit script that transforms the former into the latter is:
 * <p>
 * kitten → sitten (substitution of "s" for "k")
 * sitten → sittin (substitution of "i" for "e")
 * sittin → sitting (insertion of "g" at the end).
